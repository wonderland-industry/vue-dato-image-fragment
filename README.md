# Vue-Dato-Image-Fragment

A sustainable image fragment for a Vue + DatoCMS set up. The image fragment creates a placeholder to keep a layout shift from happening, and uses Imgix to query the correct image dimensions depending on the device screen/window size.

## Integrating the image fragment

The Image fragmnent is fairly easy to use, you integrate it in your project, after having set-up a Datocms connection, you can use the fragmnet and pass the entire image object as a prop, together with some other props such as placeholderImage, specific query or the desired background.
